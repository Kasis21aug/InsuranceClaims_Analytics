# Insurance Claims Analytics

## Overview

This project analyzes an insurance dataset to identify key factors affecting insurance charges and builds predictive models for cost estimation. The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical hypothesis testing, and regression modeling.

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration:** Visualized distributions, correlations, and trends in insurance data.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Performed hypothesis testing to determine significant variables influencing insurance charges.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Built and evaluated linear and polynomial regression models to predict insurance costs.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessed model performance using R² and residual analysis.

## Technologies Used

- Python (NumPy, Pandas)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Machine Learning (scikit-learn)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kasis21aug/InsuranceClaims_Analytics.git
   ```
2. Open `analytics.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Follow the notebook cells to explore the analysis and results.

## Results

- Polynomial regression achieved an R² of 0.85 on test data, indicating strong predictive performance.
- Key drivers of insurance charges include age, BMI, and smoking status.
